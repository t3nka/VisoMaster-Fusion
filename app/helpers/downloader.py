    Downloads a model file from a given URL, verifies its integrity using a hash,
    and handles retries on failure.

    This function is robust: it first checks if a valid file already exists.
    If the download fails, it will retry up to MAX_DOWNLOAD_ATTEMPTS times.
    A progress bar is displayed during the download.

    Args:
        model_name (str): The human-readable name of the model (e.g., "RetinaFace").
        file_path (str): The local path where the file should be saved.
        correct_hash (str): The expected SHA256 hash for integrity verification.
        url (str): The URL from which to download the file.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the file was successfully downloaded and verified, False otherwise.
